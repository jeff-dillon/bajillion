bajillion is a simple app to help relate to obscene wealth. This app is meant 
as an exmple for the Data Analysis with Python 1 course at 
[Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org/).

## The Question / The Big Idea

How does a billionaire's wealth relate to things that the rest of us might purchase? 

Let's take an example following the Oprah model: Everybody gets a Car!

What if a Billionaire bought everyone in your town a Corvette? I live in Louisville, KY along with about 600K other people. A Corvette costs about $60K. 

`600K people x $60K per Corvette = $36B`

It would cost $36 billion to buy a Corvette for every person in Louisville. 

But let's make it more specific. Here's a list of the top ten Billionaires.  

| Rank | Name | Net Worth |
| ---- | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Elon Musk | $268.1 B |
| 2 | Jeff Bezos | $188.0 B |
| 3 | Bernard Arnault & family | $186.6 B |
| 4 | Bill Gates | $134.5 B |
| 5 | Larry Ellison | $120.1 B |
| 6 | Larry Page | $119.4 B |
| 7 | Mark Zuckerberg | $117.5 B |
| 8 | Warren Buffett | $116.9 B |
| 9 | Sergey Brin | $115.1 B |
| 10 | Steve Ballmer | $98.5 B |

Elon Musk is a Billionaire. Specifically, he has $268 Billion dollars in Net Worth as of 1/15/2022.

`$268 billion - 36 billion = ~ $232 billion`

Elon Musk could buy every man, woman, and child in Louisville KY a brand new Corvette and still have over $232 billion dollars. 

`268B / 36B = 13.5%` 

It would cost Elon 13.5% of his Net Worth. What would the equivalant purchase be for someone in Louisville? The median household income in Kentucky is about $50K.

| State | Median Household Income |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| KY | $50,589 |

13.5% of $50K is $6.7K.

`$50,589 * 13.5% = $6,793`

Here's an example scale of things normal people buy:

| Purchase Size | Range | % Income | Example |
| ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| X-Large | $100K+ | 200% + | House | 
| Large | $10 - $99K | 20% - 200%  | Car |
| Medium | $1K - $9K | 2% - 20%  | Disney Vacation |
| Small | $100 - $999 | .5% - 2% | TV |
| X-Small | $10 - $99 | .02% - .2% | X-mas Tree |
| XX-Small | $1 - $9 | .002% - .02% | Coffee |


That means that Elon Musk spending 36 billion dollars to  buy a corvette for every person in Louisville, KY would be similar to someone from Louisville taking the family to Disney World.

This app will help bridge that gap by relating a Billionaire's wealth in terms of typical consumer purchases. Instead of buying cars for a city, let's look at estimates for solving big problems:

| Problem | Estimate | Source |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Provide Electricity to Sub-Saharan Africa | $160B | [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988312001144) |
| World Hunger [^1] | $45B | [Source](https://www.globalgiving.org/learn/how-much-would-it-cost-to-end-world-hunger/#:~:text=Learn%20more%20about%20the%20cost,Why%20such%20a%20big%20range%3F) |
| Homelessness in US | $20B | [Source](https://www.globalgiving.org/learn/how-much-would-it-cost-to-end-homelessness-in-america/) |
| Clean Water in Zimbabwe | $3B | [Source](https://www.wri.org/insights/it-could-only-cost-1-gdp-solve-global-water-crises) |
[^1]: average estimate for 1 year


Give the app a billionaire and a State, and the big problem to solve and the app will tell you the relative expense for the average person in your state.
